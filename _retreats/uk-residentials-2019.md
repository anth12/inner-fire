Join us in Mabie Forest, Dumfries and Galloway for one or both 5 day residentials for professional
development or to deepen your personal Yoga journey:

Transformative Yoga Training: 17th June - 21st June

Unifying and integrating Yoga philosophy with Asana (posture work), focussing on Koshas and
Chakras. We will use Pranayama techniques, Mantra and Meditation to go on an internal adventure.
Slow Flow Training: 16th-20th September

We will learn Yin and Yang Asana flows incorporating the latest fascia research to explore movement,
gaining flexibility and strength + a deeper understanding of inter-connection between all our
anatomical and subtle systems.

Both residentials are open to those who have completed 200 hour training and want to bring
something fresh and authentic to their teaching – certification will be for a 50hour advanced training
from Inner Fire. Experienced practitioners of Yoga looking to deepen their practice are also welcome
to join us. The weeks will be a mix of practical, discussion, self-study and discovery and hopefully a
few laughs along the way.
