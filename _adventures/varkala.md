Looking uncertain for 2020 but please register interest as we will be returning to Varkala when possible and safe.

Into our 6th year this is an amazing opportunity to enjoy sun, sea and healing from the inside out with Yoga and Ayurveda.

This year, Doctor Innocent has built a new purpose-built Ayurveda centre at the beautiful beach of Odayam, 3km from the popular cliff resort of Varkala in Kerala, Southern India. The sandy beach is 200m from the centre and accessible without steps.

Varkala Cliff is both tourist-orientated and a Hindu pilgrimage site where locals come to make Pooja (rituals). There are innumerable shops and cafes on the cliff run by people from all over the world but mainly Indian, Tibetan and Nepalese so you get a lovely flavour of local wares. Two kilometres away there is a thriving local town where you can also shop for silks, saris and spices.

IHA Ayurveda is a quiet haven with a warm welcome and delicious sattvic, mainly vegetarian South Indian food. Special diets can usually be accommodated if you let us know, although rice is definitely a staple of the day!

Dr. Innocent will be responsible for your Ayurvedic treatments according to your individual health: he comes from a long lineage of Ayurvedic doctors and trained for 5 years for a degree and Masters in Applied Microbiology + practical Ayurvedic experience. Each year people come from all over the globe to see him with many complex healing challenges so we are privileged to have him on site with his gentle compassionate nature and holistic approach to our well-being.
