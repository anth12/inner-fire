This year, Doctor Innocent has a new purpose-built Ayurveda centre at the beautiful beach of Odayam, 3km from the popular cliff resort and local town of Varkala in Kerala, Southern India. The sandy beach is 200m from the centre and accessible without steps. The sea and sunsets are stunning and swimming is possible although the waves can be big and currents strong (there are lifeguards on Varkala beach). You may prefer to look for dolphins from a cliff top restaurant!

You can choose a private ensuite room with fan only or A/C, or share a twin (or double for couples) with another retreat participant.

Odayam is a quiet, less developed stretch of coastline and Masy Ayurveda is a quiet haven with a warm welcome and delicious sattvic, mainly vegetarian South Indian food. Special diets can usually be accommodated if you let us know, although rice is definitely a staple of the day! There is a private swimming pool on site and gardens overlooking paddy fields where cows and cranes wander by day and fireflies flit by night.

Varkala Cliff is both tourist-orientated and a Hindu pilgrimage site where locals come to make Pooja (rituals). There are innumerable shops and cafes on the cliff run by people from all over the world but mainly Indian, Tibetan and Nepalese so you get a lovely flavour of local wares. Three kilometres away there is a thriving local town where you can also shop for silks, saris and spices.

Dr. Innocent will be responsible for your Ayurvedic treatments according to your individual health: he comes from a long lineage of Ayurvedic doctors and trained for 5 years for a degree and Masters in Applied Microbiology + practical Ayurvedic experience. Each year people come from all over the globe to see him with many complex healing challenges so we are privileged to have him on site with his gentle compassionate nature and holistic approach to our well-being.

I'll be there to offer 2 Yoga classes today. Mainly we'll be doing Asana on the roof top looking out over the Paddy fields but may also do some Pranayama on the beach or mindfulness walking. 

There will be opportunities to go to the local temples by Tuk Tuk or the nearby elephant sanctuary, plenty of shopping or browsing on Varkala cliff (15minute walk), or further afield there are historic sites or botanical gardens.

E﻿ach price includes the room, Yoga classes, Ayurvedic treatments, local food (mainly vegan), use of swimming pool. You will need to organise your own flight (to Thiruvananthrapuram airport), Indian visa, insurance and vaccinations. We can arrange airport to resort transfer. Email: deyna@innerfire.org.uk to book.
