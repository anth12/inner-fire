Are you keen to explore new areas, or do a walk of discovery, exploration and inspiration?

From January 2022, I am offering adventure walks designed to suit your needs: these could be of any distance, covering a variety of terrain (including rivers, coast, hill and moorland) and guided or not - the choice is yours!

They could include navigation skills sessions, clue trails for you to follow, a scavenger hunt of things to find, or a walk incorporating different aspects of yoga.

Please contact me to discuss your needs or ideas for a family outing, hen or stag dos, peer days out or solo support.
