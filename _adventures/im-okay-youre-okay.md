**I'm Okay, You're Okay: The Art of Connecting Human to Human**\
I'm running this training for the Occupational Therapy Society at the University of Cumbria on 13th and 14th March. They invite you to this Zoom training in health and wellbeing: understanding causes and physiological / psychological processes of dis-ease, the impact of trauma + how to build resilience and regain balance. It's free for everyone and will be particularly useful for health professionals, or anyone concerned about their own well-being.\
