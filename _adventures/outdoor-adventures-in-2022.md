J﻿oin us at the lovely Low Greenside Campsite, at the foot of the Howgill Fells in Cumbria.

During this camping yoga retreat, you will learn about yoga as a way of being in life, being with nature and simplicity. You will connect with your innate spectrums, spirals, and spheres to deepen your understanding and practice. Explore the outer environment as well as your inner self and enjoy the surrounding hills and local village. We'll make malas for chanting and visit a local nature reserve as well as the surrounding hills.

C﻿ost includes camping fees, breakfast and dinner plus all instruction and guiding.

Y﻿ou will need your own tent and camping gear, plus personal outdoor wear and boots, any extra snacks for lunch and general comfort.
