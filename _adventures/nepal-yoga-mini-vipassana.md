Our commitment to consciously being with the breath is via Zoom from 10-11am each week: 

We are now applying breathing techniques for respiratory and cardio-vascular health, deep expansion, optimum energy and increased well-being. Described by one participant as being 'brilliant' and leaving her 'euphoric'!

Can be accessed 'live' or via recordings and are donation-based according to your current financial circumstances. Open to all who want to explore beyond Asana and connect with Yoga.\
Join us by sending me a WhatsApp or email to receive Zoom links + recordings of each session.
