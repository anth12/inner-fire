Are you ready to connect with silence and explore your own inner universe in a tranquil outer environment?
Join Gopal and his family on an organic farm in Koshi, Sunsari district in eastern Nepal
from 19-29th October for 7 days of facilitated silence (Vipassana) and meditation:
sitting and moving + structured Yoga Asana (posture) and Pranayama (breath) work.
Following this we will have 5 days of exploration in the national park there: walking,
biking, hill walking, jungle treks and perhaps even with elephants.
We will also learn about organic farming in the region through mindful Karma Yoga on
the farm according to seasonal activity and follow a simple lifestyle, observing the
difference between our needs and wants.
This will be a profound personal journey of revelation and witness so please be aware
if it suitable for you at this present time.
Cost: £420, $550 or 500euros to include:
Shared accommodation in the farmhouse or your own tent
2 meals a day during Vipassana and then 3 meals a day
Travel during your stay
Vipassana facilitation
Daily structured Yoga class
Excursions to river, mountain, jungle
Bike hire
50 hours professional development credit if required
(You will organise your own flights, visa, transfers, insurance, vaccinations)
