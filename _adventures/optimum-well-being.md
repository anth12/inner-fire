How much do you really know about yourself?

Starting on Friday 8th January, 2021 from 10:00-12noon GMT via Zoom Class (or Zoom recording), during this 6 week course we visit all of our physiological systems to understand our biological well-being, the interconnectedness of our inner universe and the influence of subtle energy and psychic wisdom that makes us far more than the sum of our individual parts. We will learn to recognise the stages of dis-ease as disruption to the flow of our vital energy; and how to help prevent or manage symptoms manifesting in our physical body, whether it’s origin is genetic, environmental, mental/emotional or from an unknown universal influence.

This is a mainly theoretical course and there will be time after each class to ask questions. We could also organise a discussion group once the course has started.
