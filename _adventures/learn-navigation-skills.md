E﻿njoy a day in the Howgill fells learning basic navigation skills, making new friends and feeling a sense of empowerment. The focus will be on light-hearted learning and finding our way outwardly while feeling our confidence grow inwardly.

T﻿hese lovely rolling hills east of the M6 (junction 37 or 38) are easily accessible and offer lots of opportunity to wander. 

P﻿rice includes instruction, maps and compasses. 

Please bring your own lunch and snacks.  Come equipped for a day on the fells with sturdy boots, wet weather gear, warm clothes and poles if helpful.

I﻿f the weather is inclement we will meet at a cafe or pub to begin and end the day so please bring some money for a brew or pint. Our exact meeting point may vary according to the weather but will be at, or close to, Tebay, Sedbergh or Ravenstonedale in Cumbria.
