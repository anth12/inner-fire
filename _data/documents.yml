  Welcome to the Mulitversity of Yoga …. a network for Yoga aspirants of all ages looking to explore deeper and embracing Yoga as a union of individual and universal consciousness: those who seek to answer the age-old question: Who am I? and ‘Why am I?’
 

  Ask yourself …. Are you a student or facilitator that inquires beyond Asana (Posture)?
  

  Do you believe that Yoga is both prosaic and esoteric; scientific and spiritual; instruction and intuition?
  

  Are you eager to look beyond practice on the mat while recognising that movement can transform, strengthen and activate the energy of all the Koshas (bodies) and Chakras (energy centres)?


  Do you have a sense of threading Yoga into your life, recognising the Yamas and Niyamas as basic moral precepts of our humanity and personal / political / cultural evolution?


  Do you have the courage to ask challenging questions of yourself and others: to focus on light and dark energy for enhanced understanding; to accept all aspects of life (including death) as worthy of interest and to facilitate enlightenment?


  Are you open to transformation at all levels / layers of being?


  Through the Multiversity network we offer you global quality advanced training that recognises the four paths to Yoga: Bhakti: which may be devotional chanting, sound or other Bhakti practice Jnana (Gyana): study of classical or contemporary knowledge, Raja: practical application of Yoga philosophy and wisdom through aware Asana, Meditation, Pranayama Karma: selfless service, volunteering, community enterprise


  If you are a facilitator who provides courses, adventures or extended practice (workshops) then we invite you to join our network and share your knowledge. You will need to provide a profile of your experience and qualifications, what you are offering and why it is suitable for inclusion within the Multiversity. Your course will need to offer a degree of specialism … something beyond Asana (though not necessarily excluding it) and be committed to Yoga as the unification of individual and universal consciousness.

  
  Although this network is about offering opportunity for your own evolution and learning, wherever that may take you, there is also the possibility of certification for the courses you undertake through the Multiversity of Yoga. Please ask for details.
