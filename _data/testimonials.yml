    name: Yoga and Ayurvedic De-tox and Revitalise retreat

    description: I attended this retreat (for the 2nd year running) following an exhausting year at work and came away totally revitalised and refreshed. Deyna's twice daily yoga sessions are conducted in a professional yet sensitive way, responsive to the needs of individual participants. Sunset yoga on the beach and a meditation walk at dawn were an added bonus.

    description: I can't express how much I have learnt on Deyna's course, about yoga, about myself, about my yoga tribe and the human condition. Deyna has reinforced for me what I hoped to be true, that Yoga needs to be accessible to everyone because it has so much to offer and there is so much more than just the asanas.
