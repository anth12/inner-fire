Inner Fire is the trading name of Deyna Hirst, sometimes known by my Yoga name of Deyna Devi. 

I have studied yoga for over 30 years now: movement and postures, breathing techniques, mindfulness and meditation, as well as the philosophy and science of yoga. 

My qualifications include:

200+ hour teacher of Dru Yoga 

200 hour therapist in Ayurvedic Yoga Therapy 

Thai Yoga Masseur

500 hour teacher of Transformational Yoga

200 hour Meditation Teacher 

Nada Yoga Therapy therapist

I have also trained in Sivananda, Yin and Iyengar Yoga + Slow Flow so I offer an eclectic mix of styles and experience. 

Aside from my formal yoga skills, I am passionate about the outdoors and the holistic contribution it can make towards improved mental and physical health, exploring trauma and addiction patterns and promoting resilience and recovery.

With a social work qualification, hill and moorland leader award, and mental first aid certificate alongside years of personal experience, please be in touch for a consultation. I can promise you a programme that empowers you to manage and evolve in ways that you may not even have begun to imagine!
