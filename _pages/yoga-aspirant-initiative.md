So, this is an exciting opportunity to look beyond the mat (while continuing to enjoy any classes you already do) and follow a structured path towards Yoga as a holistic way of living. It is a 1 year programme initially that is designed to support well-being, purpose and commitment in a world that seems ongoingly chaotic and confused.
