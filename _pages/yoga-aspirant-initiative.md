Why call something the 'Healthy Orange Initiative'? 

I chose this as an orange came to my mind when thinking about this initiative: we all have our outer layer that we show as we move though life and this can be different for everyone. Peel it back and we find different segments of being; we find pith that may taste unpleasant and we may want to remove; underneath we find a juicy vibrant colour of flesh and deliciousness (unless you don't like oranges ;)!). 

An orange seems a helpful metaphor to find our way to optimum health in all our segments of being. Initially it is a 1 year programme designed to support well-being, purpose and commitment in a world that seems ongoingly chaotic and confused.

You can choose to undertake the Orange Initiative for optimum health through the philosophical paths of yoga; or as recognised aspects of well-being.
