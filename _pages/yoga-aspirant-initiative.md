subtitle: A Pathway to Optimum Health
---
Wï»¿e are created from ever-moving, ever-changing atoms and as humans, being committed to personal evolution is is essential for our holistic growth.

The personal evolution certificate recognises that structured guidance along a path can be beneficial, whether we use the language of yoga, or think in terms of our well-being. 

I invite you on a journey towards self-revelation and realisation, wherever you are and however you are in life.

Find your way to optimum health through consideration and fascination with all aspects, permutations and deviations of your own unique being. Initially it is a 1 year programme designed to support well-being, purpose and commitment in a world that seems ongoingly chaotic and confused.  

You can opt to undertake the certificate through the philosophical paths of yoga; or as recognised aspects of well-being.
