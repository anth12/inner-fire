title: Singing Bowl Healing and other One-to-one
---
For individual, personal health and healing of your own unique body, mind and life challenges. This can be muscular analysis to highlight where you are holding unnecessarily, counselling to discover what is causing stress and anxiety in your mind and body so you can move forward. Or simply treat yourself to deep relaxation through singing bowl vibrational therapy: the beautiful, uplifting sound works from the inside out, literally recalibrating and calming your energetic field - you can feel it penetrating deep into all layers of your being without any effort from you! It is great for many mental and physical conditions including stress, anxiety, muscular pain, cancer, MS and depression. Ideally you will come to my home in Kendal and relax for an hour but if necessary I can come to you. Cost:
£35 or £40 for a home session within 5 miles of Kendal. Or book a recommended 6 sessions for £190. Ring me on
