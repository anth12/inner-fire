title: Singing Bowl Healing and other One-to-one
---
For individual, personal health and healing of your own unique body, mind and life challenges. This can be muscular analysis to highlight where you are holding unnecessarily, counselling to discover what is causing stress and anxiety in your mind and body so you can move forward; relaxing vibrational therapy with singing bowls.

New for 2018 Following my training in Nada Yoga with the amazing master pictured here, I am now able to offer singing
bowl vibrational massage. This beautiful, uplifting therapy works from the inside out, literally recalibrating and
calming your energetic field - you can feel it penetrating deep into all layers of your being without any effort from
you! It is great for many mental and physical conditions including stress, anxiety, muscule pain, cancer, MS and
depression. Ideally you will come to my home in Kendal and relax for an hour but if necessary I can come to you. Cost:
£35 or £40 for a home session within 5 miles of Kendal. Or book a recommended 6 sessions for £190. Ring me on
01539592614 (from 24th February) or email for an appointment: deyna@innerfire.org.uk
