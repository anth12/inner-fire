I am qualified in therapeutic mind-body-breath techniques to help you manage or move on from stress and anxiety in mind and body. This may be:

**\*Walk, talk, stretch and breathe:** I plan a walk according to your current ability and we get out in nature to chat through any current life concerns and explore ways to enhance your well-being. Included is a write-up of the ideas we have formulated.

**\*Somatic Trauma Exploration**: this is deep, intense work to explore current discomfort or dis-ease and it's relation to a past 'traumatic' experience. Together we visit the memory to help release physical symptoms and move from the narrative of 'anxiety' to one of pressure, physiological holding and release.

**\*Revitalisation or Recuperation**: we may include muscular analysis and movement to highlight where energy is not flowing; counselling to explore where or what is challenging you in life; breathwork to control emotional reactions; strength work or fascia release as needed.

**\*Singing Bowl Relaxation**: singing bowls, placed on the body, create beautiful, uplifting sound and work from the inside out: they literally recalibrate your energetic field and you can feel it penetrating deep into all layers of your being without any effort from you! 

**\*Kosha (aspects of being) Therapy**: together we will look at how you exercise and eat; how you breathe; any current emotional or mental pressure, and deeper ingrained habits or destructive self-talk. Over a few weeks (depending on how we progress) we will develop (or I will help you access) a physical practice or activity; awareness of conscious deep breathing; a healthy lifestyle routine and diet; and constructive self-talk, for you to follow. I recommend a follow-up as needed.

Individual sessions are great for many mental and physical conditions including stress, anxiety, muscular pain, cancer, MS and depression. Ideally you will come to my home in Kendal and we'll work for an hour but if necessary I can come to you, or we can work over Zoom, or in the outdoors. My standard fee is Â£45/hour but I am sometimes able to offer discounts according to circumstances.
