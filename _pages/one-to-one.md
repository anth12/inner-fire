title: Singing Bowl Healing and One-to-One Sessions
---
I am qualified in therapeutic Yoga to help you manage or move on from stress and anxiety in your mind and body. This may include muscular analysis and movement to highlight where energy is not flowing; counselling to explore where or what is challenging you in life; breathwork to control emotional reactions; or simply deep relaxation through singing bowl vibrational therapy to calm your whole system. 

Singing bowls, placed on the body, create beautiful, uplifting sound and work from the inside out: they literally recalibrate your energetic field and you can feel it penetrating deep into all layers of your being without any effort from you! It is great for many mental and physical conditions including stress, anxiety, muscular pain, cancer, MS and depression. Ideally you will come to my home in Kendal and relax for an hour but if necessary I can come to you. Cost: £35 per hour or £40 for a home session within 5 miles of Kendal. Book a recommended 6 sessions for £200.
