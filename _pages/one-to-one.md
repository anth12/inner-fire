I am qualified in therapeutic Yoga to help you manage or move on from stress and anxiety in mind and body. This may be:

**\*Somatic Trauma Exploration**: this is deep, intense work to explore current discomfort or dis-ease and it's relation to a past 'traumatic' experience. Together we visit the memory to help release physical symptoms and move from the narrative of 'anxiety' to one of pressure, physiological holding and release.

**\*Holistic Evolution**: we may include muscular analysis and movement to highlight where energy is not flowing; counselling to explore where or what is challenging you in life; breathwork to control emotional reactions; or simply deep relaxation through singing bowl vibrational therapy to calm your whole system. 

**\*Singing Bowl Relaxation**: singing bowls, placed on the body, create beautiful, uplifting sound and work from the inside out: they literally recalibrate your energetic field and you can feel it penetrating deep into all layers of your being without any effort from you! 

**\*Ayurvedic Yoga Therapy**: together we will look at your physical body and diet + breath and movement practice and develop a healthy lifestyle routine for you to follow.

Holistic Well-being sessions are great for many mental and physical conditions including stress, anxiety, muscular pain, cancer, MS and depression. Ideally you will come to my home in Kendal and we'll work for an hour but if necessary I can come to you, or we can work over Zoom.
