Eclectic Workshops run this summer from 10am-4pm in Kendal, South Lakeland with Deyna Devi

**Sunday 2nd June: Yoga for Mindful Parenting** How do we parent mindfully in this modern world? Today we look at how to apply Yoga wisdom in your relationships with children. Although this is aimed at parents and teachers, older children are also welcome to come along. There will be opportunity for reflection, movement and discussion.

**Saturday 6th July: Meditation, Mantra and Mudra for Health & Well-being** Learn various ways of working with meditation techniques to help with stress, anxiety and over-whelm in this contemporary mayhem

**Sunday 7th July: A Taste of Ayurveda: Diet & Practice** Discover your Dosha (constitutional type) and how to balance your diet, Asana (posture) practice, Pranayama and Meditation to best support your ever-changing being. 

**Sunday 4th August: The Healing Power of Asana, Breath and Relaxation for Mind & Body** Slow Flow movement to open the physical body, focus on breath to connect mindfully with the Prana body, deep Yoga Nidra (relaxation) to calm mental and emotional body + consideration of our Wisdom body to heal and transform.

**Saturday 28th and Sunday 29th September: Pancha Kosha Yoga – Exploring our Five Bodies though Asana, Breath and Mantra** This is a truly transformative style of Yoga that will benefit qualified teachers and experienced practitioners who are looking at ways to progress, refresh and revitalise their practice. We will visit aspects of Yoga including the Apara and Para dimensions, Koshas, Chakras and the six(+) consciousnesses. Integrating philosophical knowledge can deepen our relationship with Asana and help us in our journey to Yoga as union and connection.
