With mental and physical health services at their limit, it is time to take control yourself and improve your chance of remaining healthy.

Â You can learn helpful stretches and movements, conscious breathing techniques, discuss diet and life experiences and adopt useful mindful awareness to take responsibility for your unique, individual, optimum health and well-being.

As a qualified yoga therapist and outdoor instructor with 30 years of practical experience, I can help you navigate life in many ways, suitable for you.
