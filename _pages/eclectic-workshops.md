Regular Zoom classes continue in 2023. Iâ€™d like to work on a monthly subscription basis according to your income with you having access to classes each week to offer you flexibility in your timetable. But if this feels like too big a commitment (financially or socially), join me on a donations basis.

Email me to join us on:

**Thursdays:**

**Slow Flow Asana from 07:30-08:30 GMT**

Stretch and flex to open your physical body, promote Prana flow, calm your mind and release emotional holding inviting interoception and peace within.

**Pranayama (Conscious breathing) from 09:30-10:30 GMT**

Use breathing techniques to promote digestive, immune ,respiratory and cardio-vascular health plus cultivate a deeper awareness of our inner world. This class is also recorded if you wish to access it at another time.

**Mantra Chanting from 10:45-11:15 GMT**

Finish off the morning with deep cellular activation and illumination through mantra chanting (you can mute your mic!)
