---
Join us online during the Coronavirus forced isolation for this amazing training in Therapeutic Yoga.

You will do 6 hours of self study using modules from my comprehensive manual, videos from me of Asana structure + many other Yoga techniques, YouTube resource and online research. We will also meet 2 x 2hours per week on Zoom to visit and discuss each Kosha and physiological system together + do teaching practice online in break-out groups. When restrictions are lifted we will arrange 2 weekends or 1 week in the UK to do observations and assessments OR do these in India alongside an Ayurvedic Lifestyle module OR arrange with a local partner to undertake observation and assessments in your own country: options as the world allows and shifts.

This is not just a teacher training certification course but an opportunity to investigate your inner universe; imbibe and share knowledge; learn to assist others in groups and individual sessions; explore Yoga as an ancient healing science and philosophy of human evolution.
