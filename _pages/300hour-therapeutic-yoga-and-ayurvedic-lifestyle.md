title: Educative and Therapeutic Yoga Training
subtitle: "Integrated training to enhance physical and mental health "
---
**Educative and Therapeutic Yoga Training:** in 2022 my training will be geared to all those who are educating our next generation: teachers, parents, charity workers, environmentalists, home schoolers; social workers, occupational therapists, medical professionals, mental health therapists and others.

You may not necessarily aspire to run your own studio or make an exclusive living out of teaching Yoga classes. Your motivation may be more to guide and inspire; to gently and mindfully help shift values, cultural and social expectation; to promote physical and mental well-being for all as well as a deeper understanding of our human condition + the heritage and future of the planet we share.

There will be time to chat to each other over weekends and residentials; enjoy different locations with their accompanying challenges and learning; an opportunity to consider how you can implement and adapt Yoga wisdom to contemporary living and evolution in your work and relationships.

Let's co-create not just a 'new normal' but an enlightened illuminated and evolutionary way forward as a species. The training will take place over 24 days:

**Block 1: Weekend 1: 26/27th March 2022 in or near Kendal, Cumbria. Non- residential.**

**Weekend 2: 23rd/24th April 2022 in or near Kendal, Cumbria. Non-residential**

**Weekend 3: 21st/22nd May 2022 in or near Kendal, Cumbria. Non-residential**

**Block 2: Summer, 16th-20th  July 2022 - camping in the Lake District on basic site with facilities**

**Block 3: Weekend 4: 24/25th September 2022 in or near Kendal, Cumbria. Non-residential**

**Weekend 5: 22nd/23rd October 2022 in or near Kendal, Cumbria (lead teacher via Zoom)**

**Weekend 6: 26th/27th November 2022 in or near Kendal, Cumbria (lead teacher via Zoom)**

**Block 4: Christmas … somewhere exotic? Or potentially Easter 2022 as an option ... we’ll decide together**
