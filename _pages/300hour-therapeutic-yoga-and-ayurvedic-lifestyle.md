title: 250Hour Therapeutic Yoga and Ayurvedic Lifestyle Teacher Training
---
Join us in South Lakeland for this amazing training in Therapeutic Yoga and Ayurvedic Lifestyle. 

We will meet on Fridays in 5 week blocks (with a week off in between to assimilate knowledge) between February and mid-July to thoroughly visit each Kosha and physiological system. After our summer break we return on 21st August for our final block and enjoy a September residential (21st-25th) to explore an Ayurvedic lifestyle and celebrate our journey together. This is not just a teacher training certification course but an opportunity to become a detective to investigate your inner universe; imbibe and share knowledge; learn to assist others in groups and individual sessions; explore Yoga as an ancient healing science and philosophy of human evolution.
