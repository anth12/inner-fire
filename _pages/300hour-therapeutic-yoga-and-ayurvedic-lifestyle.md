title: Educative and Therapeutic Yoga Training
subtitle: "Integrated training to enhance physical and mental health "
---
**Educative and Therapeutic Yoga Training:** in 2022 my training will be geared to all those who are educating our next generation: teachers, parents, charity workers, environmentalists, home schoolers; social workers, occupational therapists, medical professionals, mental health therapists and others.

You may not necessarily aspire to run your own studio or make an exclusive living out of teaching Yoga classes. Your motivation may be more to guide and inspire; to gently and mindfully help shift values, cultural and social expectation; to promote physical and mental well-being for all as well as a deeper understanding of our human condition + the heritage and future of the planet we share.

There will be time to chat to each other over weekends and residentials; enjoy different locations with their accompanying challenges and learning; an opportunity to consider how you can implement and adapt Yoga wisdom to contemporary living and evolution in your work and relationships.

Let's co-create not just a 'new normal' but an enlightened illuminated and evolutionary way forward as a species. The training will take place over 24 days (plus 2 assessment days) as well as home study and assignments:

**Residential 1: Friday 1st April - Tuesday 5th April 2022 at Watermillock Village Hall, Lake District (You will be able to begin teaching as a student after this). Residential cost: £525**

**Weekend 1: 21st/22nd May 2022 in or near Kendal, Cumbria. Non-residential or via Zoom cost: £195**

**Residential 2: Summer, 16th-20th  July 2022 - camping in the Lake District on basic site with facilities. Residential cost: £525**

**Weekend 2: 24/25th September 2022 in or near Kendal, Cumbria. Non-residential or via Zoom cost: £195**

**Residential 3: 23rd - 26th October 2022, hopefully in a Majorcan monastery (covid permitting). Residential cost excluding travel: £595**

**Weekend 3: 26th/27th November 2022 in or near Kendal, Cumbria (lead teacher may be via Zoom). Non-residential or via Zoom cost: £195**

**Over winter you will complete 3 individual therapeutic case studies or write a holistic education programme for your place of work.**

**Weekend 4: 24th-26th February 2023 in or near Kendal, Cumbria. Non-residential or via Zoom cost: £195**
