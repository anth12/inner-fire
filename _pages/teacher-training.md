title: Personal Involution Coaching
---
A﻿re you money-rich but empty and lost within? Do you want to K﻿now and Realise your unique, amazing mind, body and breath as an atomic, elemental miracle which is your Life.

I﻿ have trained, evolved and re-balanced with 30 years of yoga support from Indian and UK courses and people. 

S﻿hall we exchange?

I﻿ have called my approach involution coaching as it is about addressing internal existential dis-harmony. I have studied ancient wisdom and how this manifests in us and is verified by contemporary biological and neuroscientific research. 

Y﻿ou will need to have capacity to comprehend intellectual concepts of self and also be open to the experiential paradoxes we live on a daily basis. It is all eye-opening, ego-altering, mind-boggling information and you need to have the mental fortitude to cope with your own revelations, with my support. 

I﻿ charge £15000 for 200 hours of involution coaching over a time span, suitable for you: it can be one or two days a week, or a few hours per week. I'm happy to work with up to 3 people who share this expense and you can gain a certificate to share what you have learned with others (it will be accredited by Yoga Alliance International but this is an evolving approach so you will be a pioneer)
