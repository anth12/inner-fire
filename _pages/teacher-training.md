**Vedanta with Sanskrit Study** \
What if I am comfortable with who I am and how I am, even if it isn't what is desired by my self or other people around me? What if I am interested in a world beyond self?

\
What if I accepted that my mental, physical, emotional and respiratory health is naturally and unavoidably prone to fluctuations and permutations: that I, and all of us, exist on a fluid spectrum of human beingness that I slide and dance along? What if I am curious on an existential level as well as individual?\
\
This will be an amazing exploration of our dual and non-dual self (as an egoic human and divine/transcendental being) using ancient knowledge and innate or universal wisdom that offers fundamental guidance for life, health and expression. Vedanta means the culmination of knowledge and answers essential questions of humanness through study and inquiry. It's based on the ancient Indian philosophy of the Upanishads and teaches a unique relationship within yourself and with the world around you. A working knowledge of the beautiful spiritual language of Sanskrit brings extra wealth and revelation to study that can be lost in translations.

It assumes a basic knowledge and understanding of yoga philosophy (and if you don't have this then no worries - you have all winter to access YouTube!) and there will be self-study, session preparation + the opportunity for Zoom check-ins or individual support throughout. 

You can join us for your own evolution, or as yoga continuing professional development for which a 50 hour certification is available. If you are a qualified yoga teacher, it will enhance your ability to teach not primarily asana but also deep yoga wisdom that is just as relevant for health and well-being today. \
We will have 8 meetings x @5 hours of initial training and study which will take place at venues in the north-west and be mainly gyana (knowledge-based) but may also include asana (stretching), pranayama (conscious breathing) and dharana (focussed awareness). Depending on number of participants (and the weather!), we may venture into the outdoors as an elemental guru (teacher), or use indoor halls to stay dry and invite discussion.

\
You will automatically become an inaugural member of the Northern Vedanta Society UK that I am in the process of establishing. If you would like to be actively involved with this, please be in touch.

\
Fee: £575 for 8 sessions, to include: registration, co-ordination and 50 hour certification (optional), study guide handouts. Travel, accommodation and additional study materials are not included.
