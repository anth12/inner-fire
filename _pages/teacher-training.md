B﻿uild on personal evolution to become a teacher or guide and help others navigate life, health and well-being through yoga practices. 

S﻿tarting in 2024, and running over 6 modules (via a mix of weekends, online meetings and residentials) + various self-study options, you will cultivate your own self-awareness and learn ways and techniques to assist others in their progress. This is a research teacher training which will require you to study BEFORE each weekend so that you can contribute and consolidate your discoveries by sharing and experiencing with others. 

W﻿e will begin with 4 weekends, after which you can start teaching as a student: 

P﻿roposed dates:

F﻿ebruary 16-18th in Kendal, Cumbria

Summer residential:

A﻿ugust 15 - 18th - venue to be decided

A﻿ further 4 weekends or residentials will be decided between the group which we form. This may include adventures abroad or in the UK, depending on needs and development. If you wish to pursue a 500 hour training (recommended), you will be asked to undertake the Personal Evolution Certificate via the Yoga Pathway: Click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yxn4cvkmrm4chqw6iq4v1/Personal-Evolution-Certificate-Yoga.pdf?rlkey=5x8zy1zofxroxqw2g043t6iid&dl=0) for details.
