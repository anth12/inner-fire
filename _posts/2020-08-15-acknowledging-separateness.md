excerpt: It's okay to be unique
---
We are designed to be separate: to have an individual state of being, bounded by our skin. We are also programmed from birth to have collective cultural values that shape our ability to reside where we are. As we grow we may also become aware of the need for an integrative world view that harmonises humanity.\
\
Perversely it is when we don't acknowledge separateness, that conflict is more likely to arise. At an individual level we may strive to assert our thoughts, words, opinions, beliefs as the 'right' ones on a bid to create an idealistic unity which may not be possible at an egoic level. At a cultural level we may adopt notions of superiority and inferiority, primitive and advanced or first and third worlds: all imply judgement that fails to recognise the merits (and potential demerits) of each way of separate beings living collectively.\
\
Is an integral worldview possible? Has Covid-19 taught us that cooperation and communication can help our common will to live and thrive as a species?\
\
Ultimately connection is at a divine level, in the unified spirit that recognise the magic and miracle of each life always already part of a universal pulse or consciousness.\
\
Initially though, let's celebrate the ego and individuality that provides a richness and diversity. If we learn to be light, comfortable and loving within our separate self we are far more likely to be amenable to others unique way of being.
